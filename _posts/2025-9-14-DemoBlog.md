Hey, my name is Varun! I'm currently a graduate student at Columbia University studying Computer Science with an emphasis in Machine Learning. I completed my undergraduate at Santa Clara University in Computer Science & Engineering. I'm creating this page as a way to document my work, talk about topics that interest me, and learn more about website development. Feel free to contact me at my email address (listed in the sidebar) if you have any questions or want to reach out. Thanks for reading!
